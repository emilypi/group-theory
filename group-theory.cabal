version:         0.2.0.0
synopsis:        The theory of groups
description:
  This package includes definitions for Groups (monoids with invertibility), including
  finite, fre, simple, cyclic, and permutation groups. Additionally, we add the concept
  of 'Cancellative' functors, building upon 'Alternative' applicative functors.
  .
  There is plenty of other group theory related packages on Hackage:
  .
  * [groups](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/groups): minimal definition and lots of good instances.
  .
  * [magmas](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/magmas): good pedagogy
  .
  * [monoids](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/monoids): deprecated in favor of [reducers](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/reducers), which don't have @Data.Group@
  .
  * [arithmoi](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/arithmoi): Have cyclic groups, but also much more numerics
  .
  @group-theory@ tries to combine the best parts.
