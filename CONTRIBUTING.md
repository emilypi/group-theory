# Contributors Guide

## Bug Reports

Please [open an issue](https://github.com/emilypi/group-theory/issues/new) if you have a bug to report.

The more detailed your report, the faster it can be resolved and will ensure it
is resolved in the right way. I personally appreciate it when people not only open
issues, but attempt to resolve them on their own by submitting a pull request. I am
always open to constructive feedback, and I am by no means an expert, so guidance
should always be considered welcome.

## Documentation

If you would like to help with documentation, please remember to update any and
all module headers with the appropriate copyright dates, ranges, and authorship.

Expansions to the documentation are welcome, and appreciated. Every contribution counts.

## Code

If you would like to contribute code to fix a bug, add a new feature, or
otherwise improve `group-theory`, pull requests are most welcome. It's a good idea to
[submit an issue](https://github.com/emilypi/group-theory/issues/new) to
discuss the change before plowing into writing code.

If relevant, any and all claims of "performance" should be backed up with benchmarks. You can
add them to the existing benchmark suite in your PR, as long as you do not make
unjustifiable changes to the existing code.

## Code Quality

The `group-theory` project intends to focus on integration and usability,
balanced with maintainability. Please keep in mind that for a foundational
library like this, usability, portability, and API are what matters before
elegance.

## Testing

All new code should be covered by tests. Additionally, if you find uncovered material
in the existing codebase, tests are always appreciated as pull requests.
